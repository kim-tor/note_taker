## Description
Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes.


## Installation

To begin you will need to run an npm install inquirer. I also installed nodemon to monitor changes on my server.js and make sure that it remained open and updated. 

## Usage
* I was able to load the page locally but I was unable to load it using heroku. I tried using the guide but I ]repeatedly got errors. ![CMD](Develop/cmd.JPG)

When I loaded the app locally I was able to see the landing page of the note taker and I could get to the screen where I could add a note. I was unable to save the notes / delete the notes. I think there may have been issues with the routes off my post and delete functions. I accidentally deleted my original package.json so I tried to obtain it again. 

## Resources
* npmjs
* expressjs
* https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/ignoring-files
* Met with TA to go over some questions as well
