## Description
Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes.


## Installation

To begin you will need to run an npm install inquirer. I also installed nodemon to monitor changes on my server.js and make sure that it remained open and updated that is just for the development phase. If using the deployed app you can just use the UI to guide you in creating notes/deleting notes, just make sure you run a node server.js in your terminal so that the local 
host is available. 

## Usage
* Once you run node server.js in your terminal you can use the deployed link to access the note taker.
* Using the buttons on the page you are guided to create / delete notes.

Some of the functionality is not working on my note app, the save and delete. I am still working through figuring out what needs to be fixed.
